# CURVED LANE DETECTION

## SUMMARY

In this Lane Detection project, we apply computer vision techniques to detect the lanes, highlight them using a fixed color, and pain the
area between them in green

## STEPS

1. camera calibration given a set of chessboard images.
2. Apply a distortion correction to images.
3. Use Sobel to detect edges.
4. Apply Filter.
5. Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image (“birds-eye view”).
6. Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
7. Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
8. Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
9. Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
